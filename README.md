# Insurance Demo

#### Quickstart

With node installed:

```
cd server
npm i
npm run dev
```

This watches the directory and starts the node server.



#### Further Work

Improvements to the project, given additional effort and time:

- Unit tests, for both endpoints and front end
- Refactor of package.json and tsconfig.json for sharing of configuration and additional scripts for running tests / running everything
